# A Fun Experiment
I am playing a lot more with these LLM models and everything lately.
I also will soon have a very fun server-like rig at home to play with these on.
I will have a 64 core threadripper, 128gb RAM, a 12gb Gefore NVIDIA 2060 or whatever card, and 8tb of super fast NVMe drive storage.

I want to start by training models on my own tweets, then having them tweet at each other.

I know I'll be limited by context windows on hardware, but I want to figure out how to get started, functionally.

I have a postgres database with 150,000 tweets inside of it.

What do I do next?
