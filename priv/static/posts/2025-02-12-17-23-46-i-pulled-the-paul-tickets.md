# I pulled the Paul McCartney Tickets
[Dustin](TODO LINK BSKY) texted me that he was skipping our breakfast date around 8:30.

I was taking [Simon](TODO) to the vet and decided that I should go join the line with him for Paul McCartney tickets.

I missed out yesterday narrowly, so I was determined to make it today.

We did score them.
I soon after was joined by 2 guys and their mom who had come in from Jersey to try and got it.

We ate dumplings at [Vanessa's on Eldridge street](TODO LINK).
