# A fun little happening in NYC

Today around noon there was an announcement Paul McCartney would be playing The Bowery Ballroom.
I quickly rushed over and took my stand up call from the line.
We missed it by something like 30 people, but it was worth it for the story.

One ticket per person, only in person ticket sales.

I ran into Graig and Larry, which was great.

One of those ones you wont forget even if you didn't get into the show.
