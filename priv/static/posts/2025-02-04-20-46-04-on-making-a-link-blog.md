# On making a link blog

I decided I want to keep a link blog in general.

This is inspired by [Simon Wilison](https://simonwillison.net).

So, I guess his blog is my first link.

[He also writes on his approach here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/) which is interesting.

I generated this post using my new mix task in this blog's repo.

```
mix make_post on-making-a-link-blog links,blog,tech
```

Now, I just generate that then go fill in the post.
