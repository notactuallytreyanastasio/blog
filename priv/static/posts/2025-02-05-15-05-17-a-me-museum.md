# A Me Museum 
I view this space as a place to curate the best and most interesting of myself I guess.

If I were to someday just die in a random tragedy, I hope that this website will have so much "bobby stuff" that even if I am gone it will supply those I love with something.

Theres a few ways I want to go about this.
That hinge around the ephemeral nature of life and technology and data.
But I will ruminate on that a lot more later. For now, this is just a thought I felt was worth putting down:

It seems reasonable to carefully curate a digital museum of yourself together such that if you go, one day, someone who misses you can find some of that soul in those bits.
