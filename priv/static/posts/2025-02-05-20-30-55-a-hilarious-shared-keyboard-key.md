# A hilarious shared keyboard key

I saw [@itseieio](https://bsky.app/profile/itseieio.bsky.social) made this new website.

[Global Caps Lock](http://globalcapslock.com) -- it works on linux, mac and windows.

I was able to fire it up in OSX pretty quickly on my personal macbook (I would never run this on a work machine)

```
git clone git@github.com/nolenroyalty/global-capslock.git
cd global-capslock
python3 -m venv path/to/venv
source path/to-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytohn client.py
```

Lo and behold, I was synchronized.

I love silly social things like this.

Who else was I connected to?

Why were they also installing this absolutely ill advised software onto their machine?

What was giving us this laugh over lunch really?

The machines aren't all bad.
