# A Prediction: Stacked Git and AI Based Workflows
I think that over time, with AI based workflows we will see an evolution in how people approach proposing changes to code.

Why? And what does this look like?

We will take a look here.

The short answer is, "With the advent of parallel workflows accomplishing many goals and higher order forms of work, stacked diffs will become essential to managing your own personal work in ways that they never have before.

## A look at the way it works now

## A look at working the new way
I was working last night on a project where I made a couple of menu bars for the mac.
They both presented some stories from hacker news, reddit, and pinboard.
Nothing special.
But I had a plan.

I had implemented the original piece of work in Electron.

I wanted to move forward with it but I had mix of ideas on how to move forward.

### A few approaches
The codebase for the Electron app was a single file and a total mess.

I wanted to take a few different approaches with the potential paths I had.
