      <h2 id="why-you-are-here">Why You Are Here</h2>
      <p>In general, it’s difficult to work with LLMs and the related tooling
        to write software.</p>
      <p>In general, it’s also true that LLMs have become <em>very</em> good
        at writing code.</p>
      <p>Why are so many developers struggling to get real utility out of
        them? What leads to so many not impressed, but some thinking its the
        beginning of a revolution?</p>
      <p><strong>In short: I think a big part of this is simply a skill
          issue.</strong></p>
      <p>LLMs are very much like an inverted computer compared to what we are
        used to. This leads us to a situation in which we have to start thinking
        and learning in new ways. The LLM doesn’t think in 1s and 0s, in fact
        its bad at math. The interface its best at is <em>token prediction</em>.
        So sometimes, people just start brushing strokes in the wrong way and
        get bad results in their first forays.</p>
      <p>I am not here to tell people what is good practice, what is bad
        practice, and who is doing things wrong or right.</p>
      <p>What I will do is share a collection of observations that, when
        coupled together, have proven quite effective in my day to day
        engineering work.</p>
      <h2 id="what-we-will-do">What We Will Do</h2>
      <p>Today we are going to take an open problem and come up with definable
        inputs for an LLM.</p>
      <p>We will approach this in an agnostic manner. It doesn’t matter what
        tools you use, or what models you use, because we are thinking about a
        holistic methodology for approaching this, and that goes beyond what a
        model might excel at. What models excel at is certainly <em>still
          important</em> but it is not the only component.</p>
      <p>So, the way we approach this is making an app.</p>
      <p>We will get started below workshopping it, then dive straight into
        tools and building something real.</p>
      <h2 id="interactive-example">Interactive Example</h2>
      <p>See the process in action with this simplified demonstration:</p>
      <h3 id="step-0-ask-broadly">Step 0: Ask broadly</h3>
      <p>We want to begin with something that is approachable from a high
        level. This can be something as simple as a premise, but its better to
        drill things in a little more. For our example, we are going to be
        trying to get on to building a clone of a popular old link sharing
        website, del.icio.us. This first step we will utilize Claude Opus 4. Any
        reasoning model will do, though. o3 is especially impressive, too. Grok
        also can hold its own here (though I do not endorse using it).</p>
      <p><strong>We can start with a simple prompt:</strong></p>
      <div class="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-4">

          <p>I need to design an application. I am choosing to use the Elixir programming language and Phoenix framework because I have heard they have some features with real-time capabilities that may be of use to me. The application is a social bookmarking service. It features several core concepts.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-2">
            <li>A chrome extension. This simple extension saves a URL, a page title, a description, and some tags describing the page. It does this by communicating with our server.</li>
            <li>A backend service with several features: saving bookmarks, tagging them, browsing them once saved, sharing them with others, upvoting/downvoting, commenting, or more.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Can you help me structure a CLAUDE.md file to give Claude code instructions on getting started here?</p>
          <p>I need a detailed specification, because I ultimately am going to feed this into another model. Please engineer this output to be structured in a way that it is a plan Claude Sonnet 4 is ready to implement.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2 id="implementation-claude-code">Implementation: Claude Code</h2>
      <p>We will begin by getting some real outputs and go from there. We will
        use claude code for those. So, let’s begin. I am going to start an empty
        phoenix project, and populate it with my standard empty stuff to get
        started. You could really augment this piece to be any web framework and
        language you choose.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting Phoenix is somewhat niche, but I am still confident
        I can get high quality outputs here.</p>
      <div class="bg-gray-900 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
        <pre class="text-green-400 font-mono text-sm"><code>mix phx.new tasty --live</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>And with this, we can begin.</p>
      <p>
        I have added a github repository that will keep track of the code for
        this endeavour along the way
        <a href="https://github.com/notactuallytreyanastasio/tasty" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">here</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first commit with the app created is
        <a href="https://github.com/notactuallytreyanastasio/tasty/commit/eb1eebdc4c567f812449fa6a0701d63f32edf770" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">
          here
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If we examine
        <a href="https://github.com/notactuallytreyanastasio/tasty/commit/d4566a519663047e6831c0b8f46614299fffc033" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">

        </a>
        we see that we get a pretty
        broad top level specification. 357 lines!
      </p>
      <p>The core idea here is clear though: we use our tool to build inputs
        for our tool.</p>
      <h3 id="ideal-1-use-the-tool-to-make-more-tools-tm">Ideal 1: Use The
        Tool To Make More Tools TM</h3>
      <p>We can see the diff here, I simply decided to strike things to keep
        this in scope for a tutorial we can fit in the size of a single post
        here:</p>
      <p>Once we have removed this, we can begin to start to talk about tools
        and what inputs like this mean as an aside before we get to more
        hacking.</p>
      <p>From here, we now have a real working base. At this point, I am going
        to let Claude Code rip away with what we have created, but you can
        choose other tools, and we will dive into using some other tools (such
        as an editor, or a Desktop client). With this, we end up in a world
        where we have fundamentally created something that has a lot of moving
        parts and bells and whistles quite quickly.</p>
      <p>I just let claude go and kept hitting yes for about 30 minutes. It
        got pretty far.</p>
      <p>You can see the entire log <a href="#" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">here</a></p>
      <p>We can look at this Github Gist to see the entire run log, if you are
        curious. It shows quite a bit of the methodical approach Claude was
        allowed to take because of our prior instructions working over having an
        error-prone person go through this step by step.</p>
      <p>From here, we are at a point where we largely have what looks like a
        real project?! That is pretty hardcore. I thought our goal here was to
        get <em>correct</em> and <em>refined</em> and <em>focused</em> inputs.</p>
      <p>Well, that really is the goal. But first I had to impress you, and
        also give us a stage to work from that will give us a reasonable jumping
        off point to have an open problem and some actual real life style
        nebulous complexity.</p>
      <p>But first, let’s take a look at what Claude really has made for me.
        We will want to check in from your end and make sure we have roughly
        gotten to the same point in your framework of choice once you begin
        following along.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/notactuallytreyanastasio/db1c23114eeb01c394285299d8c31bfb#file-claude_session_2-md" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">
          Here
          is the log for anyone wondering
        </a>
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-we-have">What we have:</h3>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
        <li>Database schemas for everything</li>
        <li>Backend relationships all set up</li>
        <li>Channels set up for pubsub</li>
        <li>Users and Auth</li>
        <li>Interfaces to all major domain entities</li>
      </ol>
      <p>At this point, things look pretty good. We can see the state of the
        world.</p>
      <p>For good measure, at this point, I also had Claude deploy my
        application to my provider of choice.</p>
      <p>I also had it write tests for all functionality it just
        generated.</p>
      <h2 id="conquering-these-steps">Conquering these steps</h2>
      <p>So great for me, right? This all just came together. But you are
        trying to make a working piece of software, and you might not have
        luckily just one-shotted it.</p>
      <p>What do you do if it fails?</p>
      <h3 id="honestly-try-again">Honestly: try again</h3>
      <p>These outputs are nondeterministic and its a feature. Let’s use
        it.</p>
      <p>As you iterate, keep one thing in mind: it all can be thrown away
        fast.</p>
      <h2 id="refining-our-first-liveview-with-claude-code">Refining our first
        LiveView with Claude Code</h2>
      <p>We are going to review a session with claude here where we ultimately
        implement this LiveView: (use attached image)</p>
      <p>But how do we get there?</p>
      <p>Well, there are a few approaches. But with Claude Code, we are going
        to take the most “freestyle” approach possible. Instead of reaching for
        a specification, we are going to let it YOLO its way to something
        functional. In this case, we start off with a pretty simple prompt</p>
      <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 my-4 italic text-gray-700 bg-gray-50 py-2">
        <p>now let’s make a liveview. this will be our first one. it will view a
          random sampling of bookmarks from the database that are labeled public.
          To get the database off we will seed it with 100 random reddit links. it
          should also have an ability to click a tag at the top and select it then
          only show bookmarks with that tag in the feed</p>
      </div>
      <p>This is a bit more of a tall order! I let it run and it started to
        cook.</p>
      <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
        <div class="text-sm font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">⏺ Update Todos</div>
        <ul class="text-sm text-yellow-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>☐ Create database seeding script with 100 Reddit bookmarks</li>
          <li>☐ Update Bookmarks context for public bookmark queries</li>
          <li>☐ Create BookmarkLive for browsing public bookmarks</li>
          <li>☐ Add tag filtering functionality to LiveView</li>
          <li>☐ Add LiveView routes and test the implementation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>This is totally a reasonable start, but each of these tasks are
        pretty large! I guess we can just let it run though, and I did. So here
        are some highlights of what came next.</p>
      <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 my-4 italic text-gray-700 bg-gray-50 py-2">
        <p>✻ Thinking… Let me also add different source types based on the URL
          to make it more realistic. Let me update the source badge logic to show
          different types based on the bookmark URL.</p>
      </div>
      <p>So, we can see its reaching to add some color here and that isn’t
        necessarily the worst thing.</p>
      <p>We do end up in a position where we have a pretty clear path.</p>
      <p>So, I gave it some light prompts for refinement. Here they are:</p>
      <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 my-4 italic text-gray-700 bg-gray-50 py-2">
        <p>lets start off by writing tests for all the context modules and
          schemas we have created so far. This is pretty lacking in this first
          implementation. You can keep them all in one isolated commit if that is
          easy for you.</p>
      </div>
      <p>This is a pretty good step just to ensure the logic is all thought
        out. It’s an excuse to look at the tests, especially. If we cover the
        implementations right now, they are pretty well documented and make
        sense as to how they’d tie together. But let’s see if we are actually
        doing the work described.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, its super good at this and the testing loop goes
        quickly.</p>
      <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 my-4 italic text-gray-700 bg-gray-50 py-2">
        <p>now let’s make a liveview. this will be our first one. it will view a
          random sampling of bookmarks from the database that are labeled public.
          To get the database off we will seed it with 100 random reddit links. it
          should also have an ability to click a tag at the top and select it then
          only show bookmarks with that tag in the feed</p>
      </div>
      <p>This was the next big step and we are really going to get to cooking
        now that we’re giving it input this wide. And this is where our next
        step comes in.</p>
      <h3 id="ideal-2-introduce-constraints.-early-and-often.">Ideal 2:
        Introduce constraints. Early and often.</h3>
      <p>I followed up here asking it to compact the UI in various ways. What
        we ended up with is pretty nice as a start. It even nailed the sorting
        by tags, which it wrote tests for as well. Everything at this point, I
        would say, is actually by my judgement decent Elixir code. This is
        pretty impressive. But its only the beginning. From here, we will move
        on to having a data layer.</p>
      <p>But now that we have gotten some stuff onto a page, we are going to
        try to get to the same point using another tool.</p>
      <p>Once we get to this point with 3 different tools, then we will choose
        our own adventure to finish this exercise.</p>
      <h2 id="getting-started-with-claude-desktop-look-mom-no-editor">Getting
        Started With Claude Desktop: Look Mom No Editor</h2>
      <p>Why on earth write an application with absolutely no text editor?</p>
      <p>Because we live in the future. That is the tool that primitive people
        used to make software. We do not have such constraints.</p>

      <p>What we will do now is start purely with Claude Desktop and run through the same situation to get to the same point of functionality.</p>
      <p>If this sounds like a tall order, don't worry, we have a pretty robust ability to produce reasonable frontend code to get started.</p>
      <div class="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-4">

      </div>
      <p>This nets us a very large document. It can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/notactuallytreyanastasio/092feb6b7789ff050c4b5777dc53353c">here</a></p>
      <p>Overall, there is clearly a theme here: Claude Opus 4 is very good at making plans and schematics for Claude Sonnet 4.</p>
      <p>This interplay is not unique to Claude, it works between any reasoning model and a more "implementation oriented" model that you might see elsewhere.</p>
      <p>What our big takeaway is at this point, is that we can get a pretty serious tool pretty quickly.</p>
      <p>How? Well, wait just a second...its time to feed it the full specification and see what happens</p>

Here's what's included:

<h2>What's Working Now:</h2>
<p>
1. **Authentication System**
   - Register new users
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Demo user (username: `demo`, password: `demo123`)

2. **Bookmark Management**
   - View public bookmarks on the homepage
   - Add new bookmarks (when logged in)
   - View bookmark details with comments
   - Tag system with colored tags

3. **Social Features**
   - Voting system (upvote/downvote)
   - Comment system with nested comments
   - View counts for bookmarks

4. **Data Persistence**
   - All data stored in localStorage
   - Demo data created on first load
   - Multi-tab sync via storage events

5. **Navigation**
   - Hash-based routing
   - Working pages: Home, Login, Register, Bookmark Detail
</p>
<h2>Architecture Highlights:</h2>

- **Service Layer**: Separate services for each domain (Auth, Bookmarks, Votes, Comments)
- **Component System**: Simple but effective component-based UI
- **Router**: Handles navigation and parameterized routes
- **Real-time Updates**: Custom events for UI updates when data changes

<h2> Next Steps to Implement:</h2>

1. **User Profiles** - View user's bookmarks and profile info
2. **Tag Pages** - Browse bookmarks by tag
3. **Collections** - Create and manage bookmark collections
4. **Following System** - Follow other users
5. **Search** - Search bookmarks by title/description
6. **Import/Export** - Backup and restore bookmarks
7. **Bookmarklet** - Quick-add bookmarks from any page

You can now start using the app immediately! Try:
- Creating a new account or logging in with the demo credentials
- Adding some bookmarks
- Voting and commenting on bookmarks
- Opening the app in multiple tabs to see localStorage sync

What feature would you like to work on next?</p>
