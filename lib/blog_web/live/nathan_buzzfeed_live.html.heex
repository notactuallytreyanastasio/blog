            <div class="item-description">
              Nathan physically moved the replica apartment set from the first Rehearsal episode to Oregon because he felt more emotionally connected to the fake house than to real places. He found home in a constructed reality that he built to help someone else. This is peak millennial housing crisis energy.

Over 1,000 real people auditioned thinking it was legitimate. He used real contestants for his fake show within his real show to study authentic reactions to artificial scenarios.

          <p>
            Nathan Fielder is what happens when someone takes "fake it 'til you make it" SO literally that they fake themselves out of existence. He's created brilliant television about the dangers of treating life like a problem to be solved instead of an experience to be lived.
